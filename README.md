# datastructure Problem and solution
##  section1
- Fizz Buzz problem
- Palimdrome number
- Number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a number
  The solution is to find the count of 5 which are available in the factorial
  Example: !10 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10
            which is further rewritten as !10 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 2 * 5
        Ans: Number trailing zero = 2
