# Datastructure Problem and solution
## Section 1 
1. **Fizz Buzz problem**
2. **Palimdrome number**
3. **Number of trailing zeros** in a factorial of a number <br />
  **Solution** is to find the count of 5 which are available in the factorial <br />
  **Example:** !10 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 <br />
which is further rewritten as !10 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 2 * 5 <br />
**Answer:** Number trailing zero = 2
4. **Power(x, n)**
